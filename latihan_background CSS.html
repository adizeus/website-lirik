            My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I<br>
            Got out of bed at all<br>
            The morning rain clouds up my window<br>
            And I can't see at all<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>
            But your picture on my wall<br>
            It reminds me, that it's not so bad<br>
        </p>

            My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I<br>
            Got out of bed at all<br>
            The morning rain clouds up my window (window)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And I can't see at all<br>
            And even if I could it'll all be gray<br>

            Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'<br>
            I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom<br>
            I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'<br>
            Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em<br>
            But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father<br>
            If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?<br>
            I'ma name her Bonnie<br>
            I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him<br>
            I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan<br>
            I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam<br>
            I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat<br>
            Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back<br>
            Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan<br>
        </p>
